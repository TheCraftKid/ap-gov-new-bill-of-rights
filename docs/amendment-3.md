# Amendment III
**Freedom of expression**

The federal government nor the state governments may pass legislation that
prohibits, limits, or restricts an individual’s or non state-sponsored or
state-owned organization’s right to free expression, defined as one’s ability
to speak, publish, protest, petition, and assemble.

This right to freedom of expression does not preclude individuals from being
convicted over related crimes or felonies resulting from acts of physical violence.
