# Preamble
This bill of rights is not designed to rectify mistakes of the past
or to enforce equality among members of this country.

With the knowledge that government grows and expands beyond its original
powers, this Bill of Rights limits the institution of the state in order
to protect personal liberties and prevent its expansion to the size it
which it currently occupies.
