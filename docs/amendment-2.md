# Amendment II
**Right to Self-defense**

Congress nor the executive branch of the federal government may
pass any regulation that prevents a citizen from obtaining a firearm
except in cases involving a felony. No branch of the federal
government or any state government may maintain a registry of gun owners.

Under times of war declared by Congress and confirmed by the President
of the United States, Congress shall have the power to confiscate weapons
from citizens.
