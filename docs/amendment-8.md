# Amendment VIII
**Limitations of Presidential Power**

The President may not issue executive orders or mandates for
powers not explicitly outlined in the Constitution. The President
may, however, issue vetoes for laws in the process described in
Article II.

Except in cases of defense where foreign countries are directly
attacking territories of the United States, the President requires
a two-thirds majority of the Senate in order to use the armed forces
in offense against foreign actors with which the country is not
officially at war.
