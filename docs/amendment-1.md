# Amendment I
**Definition of a Citizen and Its Rights**

A citizen of this country, the United States, shall be defined as a
person who was born within the geographic boundaries of the United States
or its overseas territories, a person born to existing citizens of
this country.

All citizens of the United States are entitled to the protections under the
Constitution. Each citizen is entitled to the same rights and immunities as
every other. No branch of the federal government shall pass or enforce
legislation that provides non-citizens these rights or immunities, but
citizens who have begun the process of naturalization are entitled to these
rights and immunities.
